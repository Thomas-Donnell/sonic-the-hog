# ðŸš€ Getting Started
### To get started there are a few software you should have installed. <br /> Start by installing **Visual Studio, Unity Editor, and Unity Hub**

#### To Clone the repo first open **Visual Studio** then click clone repository in the file tab. From there you can select GitHub (Enter your Credentials), then paste the URL from this repo. <br /> The location where you save the clone doesn't matter but I prefer **(user/source/repos)**
